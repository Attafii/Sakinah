# Icon Placeholders

This folder should contain the extension icons:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (Windows)  
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

You can create your own icons or use a design tool like:
- Canva
- Figma
- Adobe Illustrator
- Or any image editor

## Design Guidelines

- Use calming colors (blues, purples, soft greens)
- Consider Islamic geometric patterns
- Include Arabic calligraphy or crescent moon symbols
- Keep the design simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Use transparent backgrounds for better integration

## Temporary Solution

Until you add proper icons, you can use simple colored squares or download free Islamic-themed icons from icon libraries.
