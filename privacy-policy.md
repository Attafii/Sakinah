Privacy Policy – Sakinah Chrome Extension

Last updated: 2025

Sakinah is a privacy-focused Chrome extension designed to provide Qur'anic reflection, memorization tools, and optional AI-assisted spiritual guidance.

1. Data Collection

Sakinah does not collect personal identity information such as name, email address, age, or account credentials.

User-Provided Content

When users choose to interact with the AI guide, the text they explicitly enter (such as questions or reflections) is temporarily sent to a secure backend service to generate a response. This data is not stored by the extension.

Technical Data

IP address information may be processed implicitly by the backend service for request delivery, security, and rate-limiting purposes. This information is not stored or linked to individual users.

2. Local Storage

Sakinah stores the following data locally using Chrome storage:

User preferences (language, notification settings, quiet hours)

Favorites and custom collections

Memorization (hifdh) progress

This data remains on the user's device and is not transmitted externally.

3. Offline Content

Core Qur'an and Hadith content is bundled with the extension and functions fully offline.

4. Data Sharing

Sakinah does not sell, rent, or transfer user data to third parties. Data is used solely to provide the extension's core functionality.

5. Notifications

Notifications are sent only based on user-configured schedules or explicit test actions.

6. Security

API keys are never embedded in the extension. All AI requests are routed through a secure proxy to protect user data.

7. User Control

Users can disable AI features, notifications, and clear stored data at any time by removing the extension or adjusting settings.

8. Changes

This privacy policy may be updated to reflect future improvements. Any changes will be published on this page.

9. Contact

For questions regarding privacy, contact the developer via the Chrome Web Store listing.
